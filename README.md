# Attention
I just made some slight improvements to this resource, as the previous ESX version was a bad. This fork inculdes better looking menu and makes it so you can only do the job when you have the trucker job!

# **TruckJob - Work as a truck driver**

## :bookmark_tabs: **Description** 
This FiveM resource enables the player to work as a truck driver and deliver cargo to locations around the map.

This job consists of 3 parts:
1. Start your shift at the truck depot, go pick up the trailer at a location.
2. Pick up the trailer and drive to the destination.
3. Detach the trailer and choose to get another job or return to the depot.  

The player will be paid based on how many trailers have been delivered.

## :bulb: **Features** 
- Customise the amount of money you get when completing a task
- Set a custom truck model for the job
- Set the possible locations for the trailers to spawn
- Set the possible destinations where you have to drive the trailer to
- Add custom trailers 

... and much more!  
Check the config.lua for more information.
